# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Mini Web Projects

Welcome to my collection of mini web projects! These projects are a series of small web applications and demos that I have built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project aims to showcase a specific feature or technique, and can serve as a useful reference or starting point for anyone looking to learn or improve their skills in web development.


## Project Topics

### The projects in this collection cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Basic HTML and CSS layouts and styling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Working with forms and user input
- JavaScript programming fundamentals
- Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Creating interactive elements and animations
- Implementing APIs and working with data


## Project List :
   
1. Expanding Card: A card with a photo that expands when clicked.
2. Progress Steps: A progress indicator for multi-step processes.
3. Moving SignUp Button: A signup button that moves based on user input.
4. Search Bar: An expandable search field activated by a search icon.

## About the Challenge

I created this project as a personal challenge to build one mini web project per day for 50 days. Each project builds upon my skills and knowledge in web development, and I hope they can serve as a helpful resource for others looking to learn or practice as well. Thank you for visiting and I hope you find something interesting or useful in these projects!
